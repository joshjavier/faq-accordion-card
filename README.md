- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Progressive enhancement

### What I learned

- `::before` and `::after` doesn't work on `img` tags.

- **Try to place `overflow: hidden` as low in the hierarchy as possible.** That way you can override it if you want specific elements to "rise above" the container.

  Case in point: the floating box on the left edge of the card on desktop view. At first, I couldn't get it to pop out of the card because the image (in this case, a pseudo-element) is anchored to the `.faq` container, where the `overflow: hidden` is also set.

  The solution: either change the anchor (element with `position: relative`) or move the `overflow: hidden` property so that a) they're not the same element, and
  b) the element with `overflow: hidden` is a _descendant_ of the anchor.

  Inside the `.faq` card, I have a `.faq-image` container which is the parent of the image, so I moved `overflow: hidden` there. The image has `position: absolute`, so it looks for the closest positioned ancestor, which is `.faq`, to be its anchor. Now, it can reach beyond the grasp of its over(flow)lord and break free from its box. Might be a bit too dramatic, but that's how you get hard concepts to stick. ;)

- Establish simple design axioms (like [measure](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(typography)>)) to make your output more consistent.
